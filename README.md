# Weather Data Clusterization Project

This project uses historical weather data to cluster global capital cities based on their climatic characteristics, such as temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The clusters represent different climatic zones, offering insights into global weather patterns.

## Features
- **Clustering Analysis**: K-Means algorithm applied to climate data.
- **Visualization**:
  - An interactive map (via Kepler.gl) showing clusters and their geographical distribution.
  - Statistical charts for cluster characteristics.
- **Data Exploration**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate seasonal and geographical patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset includes historical weather data for global capital cities and is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/historical-weather-data-of-all-country-capitals).

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation.
  - Scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering.
  - Kepler.gl: For interactive map visualizations.
  - Plotly and Matplotlib: For static and interactive charts.

## How to Use
